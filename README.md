# DATA ANALYTICS PORTFOLIO
# About
Good day, I am Mdong Kefas I am an Economist with an analytic background and currently in a learning path with IWD data camp striving to improve my skills. With my strong background in Economics I will be able to drive insights from data and also evaluate how Economic indicators (GDP, Inflation, Monetary policy, Unemployment rate) affects the economy. I am an entry level data analyst ready to improve my sills in the world of technology.

After my learning process I had little challenges with data interaction which led to my personal learning journey. In the process of learning I was able to work on complex real world dataset to be able to identify consumption pattern, sales trend and patterns. I gained experienced in sales trend, revenue pattern, cost efficiency, consumption pattern which I believe will be a great value in my in my analytics journey.

In my leisure time, I like working with new data analysis tools and techniques, and looking to greater opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. Whether working on a team or independently, I am open to discovery of new insights and the satisfaction of using data to solve complex problems.

My resume 

This is a repository that I created to track my Data Analytics progress and also build on my skills as I embark on my journey.
